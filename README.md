In my Google profit and loss project, I used One-Way Analysis to tweak factors one by one and Tornado Analysis to see how multiple factors changing together affect profit. These methods provided important insights for better financial management and decisions.
Project: Google Profit and Loss Account Analysis
Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the profit and loss account of Google through two primary methods: One-Way Analysis and Tornado Analysis. The goal is to understand the impact of various drivers on the company's profit and loss statement.

Tornado Analysis
Conclusion
1. One-Way Analysis:
In this section, we vary each driver individually within realistic ranges (±5%, ±10%) and observe the resulting impact on the profit and loss account. The purpose is to understand how changes in specific variables affect the company's financial performance.

2. Tornado Analysis:
The Tornado Analysis visualizes the impact of simultaneous changes in multiple drivers on the profit and loss account. By identifying key drivers and their relative importance, we gain insights into which factors have the most significant influence on profitability.

3. Conclusion:
Based on the findings from both analyses, conclusions will be drawn regarding the key drivers affecting Google's profit and loss account. Recommendations for optimizing financial performance may also be provided.
